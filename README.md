This is a modified version of lj-inventory. It has added animation and a bit of a nicer look and feel to it. This was edited by Generative Gaming

To change any colours, go to HTML>CSS>main.css and look for background-color and color for text and background colors.... Box-shadow for the outer glow. To remove animations you will need to remove the keyframes from CSS
